The GenapSys team has developed a Germline variant calling pipeline for the [GenapSys](https://www.genapsys.com/) sequencing technology based on Googleâ€™s [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) model. This pipeline is available for use on GenHub<sup>TM</sup> (GenapSys Cloud-based analysis platform).
